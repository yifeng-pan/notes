Let $K$ be the return on a risky investment, where $K$ is a random variable.

Let $\sigma_K^2 = \Var(K)$.

$\sigma_K$ and $\sigma_K^2$ are both used to measure \textbf{Risk}.

Risk-Free assets have no Risk, therefore is ignored for the following 
($\sigma = 0$ messes up Pearson's Correlation Coefficient): 

\textbf{Weight} $\bm{w_i} = \frac{x_i S_i(0)}{V(0)}$,
where $\sum w_i = 1$ and $K_V = \sum w_i K_i$.

$\E(K_V)$ and $\Var(K_V)$ can be calculated using the properties of $\Var$ and $\E$.
