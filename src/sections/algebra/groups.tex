% Let $S$ be a set. Suppose $a,b,c \in S$.

A \textbf{Law of Composition/Binary Operation on} $S$
% maps any ordered pair of $S$ to some element is $S$. In other words, 
is a function/map of the form
$S \times S \to S$. \\
(Common Notations: $*, \star, \cdot, \dotp, \bullet, \times, +$, or by concatenating the two elements.)

A Law of Composition on $S$ is 
\(
    \begin{cases}
        \textbf{Associative} &\iff \lall a,b,c \in S, (ab)c = a(bc). \\
        \textbf{Commutative} &\iff \lall a,b \in S, ab = ba.
    \end{cases}
\)

The \textbf{Identity/Unity} of a Law of Composition is an element $\bm{e} \in S$,
such that $\lall a \in S, ea = ae = e$.

A element $a \in S$ is \textbf{Invertible} $\iff \lis b \in S, ab = ba = e$, 
where $b$ is the inverse of $a$.

A \textbf{Group} is a set $S$ together with a Law of Composition
denoted by $\bm{G} = (S, *)$, such that
\begin{enumerate}
    \item * is Associative.
    \item $\lis$ an Identity.
    \item Every element of $S$ is Invertible.
\end{enumerate}

A \textbf{Abelian Group} is a Group that is Commutative.

The \textbf{Order} of a Group $(S, *)$ is the number of elements in the group,
where $\bm{\abs{G}} = \abs{(S, *)} = \abs{S}$. \\
(Notation: $(S, *)$ should not be treated as an ordered set, 
for instance: $(\R, \times) = \R^\times$, and $(\Z, +) \subseteq (\R, +)$.)

A Group $H$ is a \textbf{Subgroup of} a Group $G$
$\iff H \subseteq G \land \lall a,b \in H, ab \in H$ (\textbf{Closure}). \\
(Closure is a part of the definition of a Law of Composition.)

Every Group $G$ has two trivial Subgroups: $G$ and $\set{e}$.


% Let $(S, *)$ denote the set $S$ under a binary operation $*$.

% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item $S$ is closed under a binary operation.
%     \item The operation is associative.
%     \item The operation has a identity/unity.
%     \item Every element of $S$ has an inverse in $S$.
%     \item The operation is commutative.
% \end{enumerate}

% $S$ is a \textbf{Monoid} 
% $\iff$ 1, 2 and 3.

% $S$ is a \textbf{Group}
% $\iff$ $S$ is a Monoid, 4.

% $S$ is a \textbf{Albelian Group}
% $\iff$ $S$ is a Group and 5.

% If $S$ is finite, the \textbf{Order} of $S$ is the number of elements in $S$, 
% denoted by $\abs{S}$.\\
% (Notation: $\abs{(S, *)}$ means $\abs{S}$ most of the time.)

% % A \textbf{Binary Operation} $\bm{*}$ on a set $\bm{S}$ maps every ordered pair $(a,b)$ 
% % to some element $c$, where $a,b,c\in S$.
