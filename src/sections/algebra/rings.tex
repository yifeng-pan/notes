A \textbf{Ring} $R$ is a set two binary operation $+$ and $\times$,
refered to as \textbf{Addition} and \textbf{Multiplication}, such that
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $(R, +)$ is an abelian group denoted as $R^+$, with the identity denoted as $0$.
    \item $\times$ is Commutative and Associative, with the identity denoted as $1$.
    \item $\lall a,b,c\in R, (a+b)c = ac + bc$. (Distributive Law)
\end{enumerate}

% A \textbf{Subring} of $R$ is a ring ...
