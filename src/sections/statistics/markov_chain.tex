State $j$ is \textbf{Accessible} from state $i \iff P^n_{ij} > 0$ for some $n \geq 0$.

If two states $i$ and $j$ are accessible to each other, 
then they are \textbf{Communicate}, denoted as $i \llra j$.

A Markov Chain is \textbf{irreducible} $\iff$ there is only one class.


Let $\bm{f_i}$ denote thet probability that, starting in state $i$, the process will ever reenter state $i$.

State $i$ is \textbf{Recurrent} if $f_i = 1$, and \textbf{Transient} if $f_i < 1$.

Recurrent and Transient are class properties.


State $i$ has a \textbf{Period} of $d \iff n \not\cmod{0}{d} \lif P_{ii}^n = 0$, 
where $d$ is the largest integer with this property.

A state is \textbf{Aperiodic} $\iff$ it has a peroid of $1$.

Periodicity is a class property.


If state $i$ is reccurent, 
and starting in $i$, the expected time until the process returns to state $i$ is finite,
then it is \textbf{Positive Reccurent}.

Positive Reccurency is a class property.

A state is \textbf{Ergodic} $\iff$ it is positive recurrent and aperiodic.


If a Markov Chain is irreducible and ergodic, then $\lim_{n\to+\infty} P_{ij}^n$ exists
and is independent of $i$.
Let $\bm{\pi_j}$ be the \textbf{Erodic/Limiting Probabilities},
where $\pi_j = \lim_{n\to+\infty} P_{ij}^n$.
